Hi,
Today i appended my knowledge with Git and Github. Particulated my local repository file in the master branch  to the GitHub community and vis-a-vis.I implemented the cloning of repositories to and fro from the Git and Github,got a good hands on .gitignore configuration as well.Learned about the different regex use in hiding a folder a file or a like type file from git using the edit of .gitignore.
I also learned about how the git is used in version control including merging of different branches into it and how GitHub played a vital role in agile methodology. I tried to configure the access controls of a particular project.Different tools through which git can be managed including Git Bash.

Along with this got a deeper dive in scrum as per morning session and tried to use that knowledge and linking in Git.
